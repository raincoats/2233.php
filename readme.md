2233.php
========

## Overview

2233.php is a webshell generator, it generates the function and variable names for a web shell on each run, and spits them to stdout.

## Usage

    $ php -f 2233.php

...and then a new web shell pops out.
    
See `example.php` for an example of the shells it produces. They're all pretty much the same format, just randomized variable/function names.
